# IoT temperature sensor

This a a project for Rasberry PI 2 to act as a temperature sensor using Sunfounder components. Ansible is used to manage configuration and software via ssh.

## Prequisites

* Rasberry Pi 2
* Rasberry PI preinstalled Rasbian Debian Jesse lite from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ to SD card and SSH on it enabled with ie. raspi-config
* Sunfounder components built temperature sensor. See Sensor Kit V2.0 for Rasberry Pi B+ guide page 91 or https://www.sunfounder.com/learn/sensor-kit-v2-0-for-b/lesson-18-temperature-sensor-sensor-kit-v2-0-for-b.html
